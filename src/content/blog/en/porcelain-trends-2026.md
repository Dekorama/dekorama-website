Porcelain tile continues to be the favorite covering for floors and walls in renovations and new construction. In 2026, trends point to **larger formats**, **nature-inspired finishes**, and **palettes that provide warmth** without sacrificing durability. Let's review the key points you should know.

## XXL Formats and Minimalism

**Extra-large formats** (120x280 cm, 160x320 cm, and even larger) continue to rise. A single piece covers more surface area, joints are reduced, and the result is cleaner and more contemporary. Ideal for living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms where you seek pure lines.

## Marble and Natural Stone Effect

**Marble** and **natural stone** remain references. In 2026, marked veining, cream tones, grays, and deep blacks are in demand. Technical porcelain reproduces these textures with great realism and with the advantage of much simpler maintenance.

## Wood-Look Porcelain (Hydraulic and Plank)

**Wood** as inspiration never goes out of style: long planks, light tones (oak, beech), and also dark ones (walnut, wenge). In areas with humidity or heavy traffic, wood-look porcelain offers the same aesthetics with greater resistance to water and wear.

## Earth Tones and Warm Colors

The palette leans toward **beige, terracotta, sand, and earth tones**. It moves away from the cold gray dominant in previous years and brings the space closer to a more cozy feeling, very aligned with the *warm minimalism* style.

## Tactile and Matte Textures

**Matte finish** remains the most requested: fewer reflections, more natural appearance, and better performance against stains and fingerprints. Slightly rough or rustic textures add character and anti-slip safety in bathrooms and walkways.

## Summary

- **XXL formats** for fewer joints and clean lines.
- **Marble and stone imitation** with marked veining and natural tones.
- **Wood effect** in plank, ideal for humid areas.
- **Warm palette**: beige, terracotta, and earth tones.
- **Matte finish** and discreet textures for a current and easy-to-maintain look.
